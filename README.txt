My application is called "The Ye Fortune Cookie Generator". Kanye West is well known for (among other things like his music) his
sometimes hilarious, sometimes strange, and always very interesting public statements.
This website provides the user with a "fortune cookie" that is a Kanye quote. This quote is linked to the user's name and email.
The user can review their specific quote using their email address (user's name, email, and quote are all stored in MongoDB).
It is a fun and silly little application.
